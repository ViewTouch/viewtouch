### Fixed
- **Auto Receipt Printing "Never" Setting**: Fixed issue where auto receipt printing always occurred even when set to "Never"
  - Root cause: ReceiptPrintType enum values were incorrectly mapped, causing RECEIPT_NONE (0) to display as "On Send" instead of "Never"

  - Updated ReceiptPrintValue/ReceiptPrintName arrays to match new enum order
  - Files modified: `main/data/settings_enums.hh`, `main/data/settings.cc`
- **Remote Display Graceful Shutdown**: Fixed issue where remote displays don't know when the ViewTouch client application exits

- **Kitchen Video Print Method "Matched" Empty Report Error**: Fixed issue where setting "Kitchen Video Print Method" to "Matched" caused video targets to break with "ReportRender: can't render report with empty body" error
  - **Root Cause**: `PrintWorkOrder()` method was designed for printer output and would return early when no orders needed printing, but for video display it should always show check information
  - **Solution**: Modified `PrintWorkOrder()` to continue execution for video display mode (`rzone != nullptr`) even when no orders match the video target
  - **Impact**: Video targets now display properly with "Matched" setting, showing check headers even when no orders are assigned to specific video targets
  - **Files Modified**: `main/business/check.cc` - Enhanced `PrintWorkOrder()` method with video display handling
- **Self-Order Button Differentiation**: Fixed issue where `quickdinein` and `quicktogo` buttons on self-order page didn't work correctly

  - **Solution**: Updated message handling to use correct self-order check types (`CHECK_SELFDINEIN`, `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`)
  - **Impact**: Self-order buttons now properly differentiate between dine-in and take-out orders as intended
  - **Files Modified**: `zone/button_zone.cc` - Fixed message handling in `MessageButtonZone::Signal()` method

### Removed
- remove GTK+3 dependency, only used in loader, where we revert to use X11 directly #127

### Fixed
- **Printer Duplication Bug**: Fixed critical issue where printers were being duplicated after ViewTouch restart
  - **Root Cause**: System was creating new "Report Printer" entries on every startup without checking if one already existed
  - **Problem**: Each restart would add another report printer to settings, causing multiple duplicate entries
  - **Solution**: Added duplicate check using `settings->FindPrinterByType(PRINTER_REPORT)` before creating new report printers
  - **Implementation**: Modified report printer creation logic in `StartSystem()` function to reuse existing printers
  - **Result**: Only one report printer is created and maintained across multiple restarts
  - **Files Modified**: `main/data/manager.cc` - Enhanced printer initialization with duplicate prevention
  - **Impact**: Eliminates printer duplication in settings, maintains clean configuration files
- **Version Number and Date Update**: Updated version number to reflect current year and fixed version date display in Page 1 lower left corner
  - **Version Number**: Updated from "21.05.1" to "25.01.1" to reflect current year 2025
  - **Version Date**: Fixed version date display to show current build date (2025-09-18) instead of cached 2021 date
  - **Root Cause**: Version timestamp was correctly generated but cached version_generated.hh file contained old date
  - **Solution**: Updated version.cmake with new major/minor version numbers and regenerated version files with `make clean` and `make`
  - **Result**: Version display now correctly shows "POS 25.01.1-74 2025-09-18" with current year and build date
- **SelfOrder Mode Differentiation**: Added support for SelfDineIn and SelfTakeOut check types in SelfOrder mode
  - **New Check Types**: Added `CHECK_SELFDINEIN` (11) and `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT` (12) to distinguish between dine-in and take-out orders

  - **Updated Logic**: Modified `IsSelfOrder()`, `IsTakeOut()`, and `IsForHere()` methods to include new SelfOrder variants
  - **Terminal Support**: Updated `QuickMode()` method to handle new SelfOrder check types with proper validation
  - **Files Modified**: `main/check.hh`, `main/check.cc`, `main/terminal.cc`
- **SelfOrder Drawer Access Issue**: Fixed "No Drawer Available" message when drawer is configured for SelfOrder terminals
  - **Root Cause**: Customer user (ID 999) created for SelfOrder terminals lacked `SECURITY_SETTLE` permission needed for drawer access
  - **Solution**: Updated Customer user setup to include `SECURITY_SETTLE` permission in addition to existing `SECURITY_TABLES` and `SECURITY_ORDER`
  - **Implementation**: Modified all three Customer user creation locations in `main/terminal.cc` to grant proper permissions
  - **Result**: SelfOrder terminals can now properly access drawers for payment processing without errors
- **Check Type Constants Backward Compatibility**: Fixed data corruption issue caused by renumbering existing check type constants
  - **Problem**: Renumbering `CHECK_DINEIN`, `CHECK_TOGO`, and `CHECK_CALLIN` from values 11-13 to 13-15 broke backward compatibility
  - **Impact**: Saved checks with old type values (11 for `CHECK_DINEIN`) were misinterpreted as new types like `CHECK_SELFDINEIN`, causing incorrect behavior and data corruption
  - **Solution**: Restored original values for existing constants and reassigned new values to `CHECK_SELFDINEIN` and `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`
  - **New Values**: `CHECK_DINEIN`=11, `CHECK_TOGO`=12, `CHECK_CALLIN`=13, `CHECK_SELFDINEIN`=14, `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`=15
  - **Result**: Existing saved checks with old type values now work correctly without data corruption
- **IsToGo() Method Consistency**: Fixed inconsistency in `IsToGo()` method to include `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`
  - **Problem**: `IsToGo()` method didn't account for `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`, creating inconsistency with other related methods
  - **Impact**: Self-service takeout orders (`CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`) were not properly identified as "to go" orders
  - **Solution**: Updated `IsToGo()` method to include `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT` check type
  - **Consistency**: Now matches pattern used in `IsTakeOut()` and `IsForHere()` methods which include their corresponding self-service types
  - **Result**: Self-service takeout orders are now correctly identified as "to go" orders
- Allow settlement after reset for users with Settle permission
  - Removed terminal-type restriction in `Terminal::CanSettleCheck()` that blocked settling on `ORDER_ONLY` terminals after reset
  - Settlement still requires a valid drawer and respects ownership/supervisor checks
- fix configure step by searching for `PkgConfig` before using `pkg_check_module` #128
- update embedded `catch.hpp` to `v2.13.10` to fix compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 and newer #131

  - Added early exit in `BalanceReportWorkFn` when no checks exist to process
  - Prevents work function from being rescheduled indefinitely when database is empty
  - Report now completes immediately and shows appropriate empty state
- **Fixed: "Refresh ViewTouch" Hanging Issue**
  - **Root Cause**: Segmentation fault in `XtRemoveInput()` during X11 resource cleanup
  - **Problem**: ViewTouch would hang on "Shutting Down" when trying to remove X11 input handlers with invalid context
  - **Solution**: Added proper validation and error handling for all `XtRemoveInput()` calls
    - Added `App != NULL` check in `RemoveInputFn()` before calling `XtRemoveInput()`
    - Wrapped `XtRemoveInput()` calls in try-catch blocks in `term_view.cc`
    - Added error logging for invalid Xt context scenarios
    - Ensured input IDs are properly reset to 0 after removal
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `main/manager.cc` - Enhanced `RemoveInputFn()` with context validation
    - `term/term_view.cc` - Added exception handling in `SocketInputCB()`, `StopTouches()`, and cleanup functions
  - **Result**: "Refresh ViewTouch" button now works correctly without hanging
  - **Impact**: System restart (`sudo shutdown -r now`) also works properly from within ViewTouch
  - **Testing**: Verified restart functionality with signal testing - old process terminates cleanly, new process starts successfully
