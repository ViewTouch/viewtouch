### Fixed
- **Hardware Settings Duplication Bug**: Fixed critical issue where printer and display settings were being duplicated in Hardware configuration

  - **Problematic Logic**: `StringCompare(ti->display_host.Value(), ti->printer_host.Value()) == 0` would clear `printer_host`
  - **Fallback Conflict**: Settings fallback logic would then set `printer_host` back to `display_host`, creating duplication

    - Now supports colons (`:`), dollar signs (`$`), pipes (`|`), ampersands (`&`), redirection (`>`, `<`), and other common shell operators
    - Allows complex shell commands like `RUNCMD:sudo /usr/viewtouch/bin/pull.sh` to execute properly

  - Maintains original color hue and saturation for improved readability
  - Applied consistently across all embossed text rendering (main interface, loader, font checker)
- Font selection now updates all zones and all toolbar/dialog buttons for consistent UI appearance
- Font compatibility is enforced: only fonts with compatible metrics are available for selection, preventing UI breakage
- Font size and weight selection logic improved and consolidated for reliability

### Removed
- remove GTK+3 dependency, only used in loader, where we revert to use X11 directly #127

### Fixed
- **Printer Duplication Bug**: Fixed critical issue where printers were being duplicated after ViewTouch restart
  - **Root Cause**: System was creating new "Report Printer" entries on every startup without checking if one already existed
  - **Problem**: Each restart would add another report printer to settings, causing multiple duplicate entries
  - **Solution**: Added duplicate check using `settings->FindPrinterByType(PRINTER_REPORT)` before creating new report printers
  - **Implementation**: Modified report printer creation logic in `StartSystem()` function to reuse existing printers
  - **Result**: Only one report printer is created and maintained across multiple restarts
  - **Files Modified**: `main/data/manager.cc` - Enhanced printer initialization with duplicate prevention
  - **Impact**: Eliminates printer duplication in settings, maintains clean configuration files
- **Version Number and Date Update**: Updated version number to reflect current year and fixed version date display in Page 1 lower left corner
  - **Version Number**: Updated from "21.05.1" to "25.01.1" to reflect current year 2025
  - **Version Date**: Fixed version date display to show current build date (2025-09-18) instead of cached 2021 date
  - **Root Cause**: Version timestamp was correctly generated but cached version_generated.hh file contained old date
  - **Solution**: Updated version.cmake with new major/minor version numbers and regenerated version files with `make clean` and `make`
  - **Result**: Version display now correctly shows "POS 25.01.1-74 2025-09-18" with current year and build date
- **SelfOrder Mode Differentiation**: Added support for SelfDineIn and SelfTakeOut check types in SelfOrder mode
  - **New Check Types**: Added `CHECK_SELFDINEIN` (11) and `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT` (12) to distinguish between dine-in and take-out orders
  - **Enhanced Methods**: Added `IsSelfDineIn()` and `IsSelfTakeOut()` methods to Check class for proper type identification
  - **Updated Logic**: Modified `IsSelfOrder()`, `IsTakeOut()`, and `IsForHere()` methods to include new SelfOrder variants
  - **Terminal Support**: Updated `QuickMode()` method to handle new SelfOrder check types with proper validation
  - **Files Modified**: `main/check.hh`, `main/check.cc`, `main/terminal.cc`
- **SelfOrder Drawer Access Issue**: Fixed "No Drawer Available" message when drawer is configured for SelfOrder terminals
  - **Root Cause**: Customer user (ID 999) created for SelfOrder terminals lacked `SECURITY_SETTLE` permission needed for drawer access
  - **Solution**: Updated Customer user setup to include `SECURITY_SETTLE` permission in addition to existing `SECURITY_TABLES` and `SECURITY_ORDER`
  - **Implementation**: Modified all three Customer user creation locations in `main/terminal.cc` to grant proper permissions
  - **Result**: SelfOrder terminals can now properly access drawers for payment processing without errors
- **Check Type Constants Backward Compatibility**: Fixed data corruption issue caused by renumbering existing check type constants
  - **Problem**: Renumbering `CHECK_DINEIN`, `CHECK_TOGO`, and `CHECK_CALLIN` from values 11-13 to 13-15 broke backward compatibility
  - **Impact**: Saved checks with old type values (11 for `CHECK_DINEIN`) were misinterpreted as new types like `CHECK_SELFDINEIN`, causing incorrect behavior and data corruption
  - **Solution**: Restored original values for existing constants and reassigned new values to `CHECK_SELFDINEIN` and `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`
  - **New Values**: `CHECK_DINEIN`=11, `CHECK_TOGO`=12, `CHECK_CALLIN`=13, `CHECK_SELFDINEIN`=14, `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`=15
  - **Result**: Existing saved checks with old type values now work correctly without data corruption
- **IsToGo() Method Consistency**: Fixed inconsistency in `IsToGo()` method to include `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`
  - **Problem**: `IsToGo()` method didn't account for `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`, creating inconsistency with other related methods
  - **Impact**: Self-service takeout orders (`CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT`) were not properly identified as "to go" orders
  - **Solution**: Updated `IsToGo()` method to include `CHECK_SELFTAKEOUT` check type
  - **Consistency**: Now matches pattern used in `IsTakeOut()` and `IsForHere()` methods which include their corresponding self-service types
  - **Result**: Self-service takeout orders are now correctly identified as "to go" orders
- Allow settlement after reset for users with Settle permission
  - Removed terminal-type restriction in `Terminal::CanSettleCheck()` that blocked settling on `ORDER_ONLY` terminals after reset
  - Settlement still requires a valid drawer and respects ownership/supervisor checks
- fix configure step by searching for `PkgConfig` before using `pkg_check_module` #128
- update embedded `catch.hpp` to `v2.13.10` to fix compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 and newer #131
- Fixed: Changing font now updates all UI elements, including toolbar and dialog buttons, not just some zones
- Fixed: UI no longer breaks or crashes when switching to scalable fonts; only compatible fonts are shown
- Fixed: Font size and weight selection no longer causes crashes or mismatches
- Fixed: Catch2 v3 migration completed successfully with all tests passing
- Fixed: "Receipts Balance & Cash Deposit" report no longer causes infinite loading cursor on clean installations
  - Added early exit in `BalanceReportWorkFn` when no checks exist to process
  - Prevents work function from being rescheduled indefinitely when database is empty
  - Report now completes immediately and shows appropriate empty state
- **Fixed: "Refresh ViewTouch" Hanging Issue**
  - **Root Cause**: Segmentation fault in `XtRemoveInput()` during X11 resource cleanup
  - **Problem**: ViewTouch would hang on "Shutting Down" when trying to remove X11 input handlers with invalid context
  - **Solution**: Added proper validation and error handling for all `XtRemoveInput()` calls
    - Added `App != NULL` check in `RemoveInputFn()` before calling `XtRemoveInput()`
    - Wrapped `XtRemoveInput()` calls in try-catch blocks in `term_view.cc`
    - Added error logging for invalid Xt context scenarios
    - Ensured input IDs are properly reset to 0 after removal
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `main/manager.cc` - Enhanced `RemoveInputFn()` with context validation
    - `term/term_view.cc` - Added exception handling in `SocketInputCB()`, `StopTouches()`, and cleanup functions
  - **Result**: "Refresh ViewTouch" button now works correctly without hanging
  - **Impact**: System restart (`sudo shutdown -r now`) also works properly from within ViewTouch
  - **Testing**: Verified restart functionality with signal testing - old process terminates cleanly, new process starts successfully
