ViewTouch is a registered trademark in the USA.

ViewTouch is the ORIGINAL Graphical Touchscreen Restaurant Point of Sale Interface, first created by restaurateur Gene Mosher and C programmer, Nick Colley, in 1986.  Initial funding of the development of the code in '86 was due to the effort of Ed Ramsay.  ViewTouch was first demonstrated to the public at ComDex, Las Vegas in November, 1986. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png  The current version of ViewTouch was first created in 1995-98 by Gene Mosher and C Programmer, Richard Bradley.  Major funding of the development of the code during the '95-'98 period is due to the effort of Billy Foster.  Extensive enhancement of the code was carried out from 2000-04 by Bruce King. Major funding of the development of the code during the '00-'04 period is due to the effort of Doug DeLeeuw.  Since the arrival of ViewTouch under the GNU Public License in 2014 ViewTouch code has been available at GitHub and a great deal of refinement and modernization of the code has taken place.  Special thanks to Jack Morrison and Reinhold Gschweicher.  Gene and Barbara Mosher have provided lifetime support and funding for ViewTouch from its inception. Gene owns the ViewTouch copyright and has overseen the management of the code during its entire lifetime.

With the availability of ViewTouch source code under the GPL and the arrival of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's computers a restaurateur can automate one's own restaurant.  ViewTouch makes available Point of Sale computers powered by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module.  These are made by the Chinese company, Chipsee.

Android tablets and smartphones can be used as mobile POS devices by using a QR Code scanner at http://viewtouch.com/nc.html to install the ViewTouch Android X Server on them. The most recent ViewTouch Raspberry Pi image is also available at this link.

The availability of ViewTouch source code and documentation at GitHub benefits the clients, customers and associates of Gene Mosher and it facilitates the development and maintenance of ViewTouch source code.

More Viewtouch POS (Point of Sale) History
=========
ViewTouch first ran as a C program on the Atari ST computers in 1986. The Atari ST was a very exciting platform under Jack Tramiel from 1985 until 1993/4. In 1995 development of ViewTouch under UNIX began. At that time we were using Power Computing (i.e., Power PC) computers manufactured by The Computer Group at Motorola and the operating system was IBM's version of UNIX, (AIX).
When computer manufacturer Atari ceased operations, in 1993, if one didn't want to use Microsoft DOS or Apple computers, UNIX was one's only choice, and MIT's X Window System was the only practical choice with which one could build tools which could then be used to create a network transparent graphical interface.  This is precisely the decision which was made for ViewTouch in early 1995.
In 1997 the decision was made to move from AIX on the Motorola PowerPC to the Red Hat Linux distribution on the Intel X86 platform. In 2000 a transition from C to C++ and from Red Hat to Debian took place.  ViewTouch remains on Debian as the default distribution and features the XFCE desktop.
Since 2016 the default hardware platform for Viewtouch is the family of Raspberry Pi computers. ViewTouch production POS computers provide a desktop icon which compiles and installs the latest version of the code from GitHub.
ViewTouch Point of Sale isn't just about the advantage of the power of Linux; it's also about the advantage of the remote display capability of The X Window System. To add additional ViewTouch PoS sessions, use either Android Tablets running the ViewTouch Android XServer .apk file or or touchscreen monitors driven by any Raspberry Pi computer.  Then just add the IP address of such a device to the ViewTouch page 'View & Manage Displays & Printers'.

Payment gateway/processors
=========
The ViewTouch GUI has the Monetra Credit/Debit Card Verification engine integrated into it and can be used with virtually any payment processor. Visit the Monetra web site to see the certifications and the site licenses charges, which are quite reasonable, and the role they play in all this. ViewTouch does not have to play with any payment gateway at all - it's 100% optional.

ViewTouch POS on Android
=========
ViewTouch can send a remote display/input session to any Android tablet or smartphone. The Android X Server is based on XSDL and can be downloaded from QR Codes found either on the ViewTouch desktop or from http://www.viewtouch.com/nc.html.  Many, many thanks to Sergii Pylypenko, of Kiev, Ukraine for creating and maintaining a special version of XSDL for ViewTouch !!
