ViewTouch is a registered trademark in the USA.

ViewTouch is the ORIGINAL Graphical Touchscreen Restaurant Point of Sale Interface, first created by Gene Mosher in 1986. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Comdex_1986.png

With the availability of ViewTouch source code under the GPL and the arrival of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's computers a restaurateur can automate one's own restaurant at virtually NO EXPENSE! Android tablets can be used as X terminals by downloading the ViewTouch Android X Server at http://viewtouch.com/download.html  The most recent ViewTouch Raspberry Pi image is also available at this link.

The availability of ViewTouch source code and documentation at GitHub is twofold: it benefits the clients, customers and associates of Gene Mosher and it facilitates the free development and maintenance of ViewTouch source code.

_An important link at the top of this page is the Wiki link. It contains a page with build instructions and a page with the latest news._

History of the Viewtouch POS system
=========
ViewTouch first ran as a C program on the Atari ST computers in 1986. The Atari ST was a very exciting platform under Jack Tramiel from 1985 until 1993/4. In 1995 development of ViewTouch under UNIX began. At that time we were using Power Computing (i.e., Power PC) computers manufactured by The Computer Group at Motorola and the operating system was IBM's version of UNIX, which they called AIX.
In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the first thing he did was to kill the clones and to do that he bought PowerComputing outright to stop sales cannibalization of Apple-branded models. That was the end of the PowerPC at Motorola.
When Atari died, if you didn't want to do Microsoft DOS or Apple, UNIX was your only choice, and X was your only choice to build the graphical interface.
In 1998 we moved from AIX on PowerPC to Red Hat on X86. In 2000 we began the transition to C++ and switched from Red Hat to Debian.  We remain with that as the default distribution today, featuring the XFCE and LXDE desktop environments.
In 2017 our hardware platforms are the Intel NUC and Raspberry Pi ARM computers. ViewTouch production computers provide all the files necessary to compile the latest GitHub version.
ViewTouch Point of Sale isn't just about the advantage of the power of Linux; it's also about the advantage of the remote display capability of The X Window System. To add display terminals one doesn't need to copy the program or data. All one does is open another user display terminal by adding its IP address to the ViewTouch GUI.

Payment gateway/processors
=========
The ViewTouch GUI has the Monetra Credit/Debit Card Verification engine integrated into it and can be used with virtually any payment processor. Visit the Monetra web site to see the certifications and the site licenses charges, which are quite reasonable, and the role they play in all this. ViewTouch does not have to play with any payment gateway at all - it's 100% optional.

ViewTouch POS on Android
=========
ViewTouch looks exactly the same on any Android tablet as it does on any display monitor, regardless of the resolution. The Android X Server we use is based on XSDL, which handles that transformation and much thanks to Sergii Pylypenko, of Kiev, for all of this!
